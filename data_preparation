## ðŸ”— Connecting MySQL to Tableau

- After creating the schema `ToyCraft_Tales` and importing the dataset into the `toy_manufacturers` table, we connected Tableau directly to MySQL.
- Tableauâ€™s **MySQL connector** was used with the following configuration:
  - Server: `localhost`
  - Port: `3306`
  - Username: `root` (or your MySQL user)
  - Password: [your password]
- The table was loaded and used directly for visualizations.
